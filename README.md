Author: Zachary Bochanski
Project Number: project/test 5
Description: This program explores the use of macros by reading a user entered
String, the string is validated by converting it to numerical values and throws
an exception if the values are incorrect according to the requirements. (The focus of this project is 
employing the use of MACROS, further refineing assembly skills, and
on using STOSB/LODSB etc.)

The flow of this program, based on the requriments, is as follows:

1. Get string input
2. Convert to integer
3. Store in array
4. Convert to hex string
5. Display
 
To summarize, this program reads an writes strings to the console however,
it stores and manupulates the actual numerical value.
